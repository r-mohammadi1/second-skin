$NAME is using the SecondSkin prounoun testing program. $SUBJECT has done this by downloading the binary from the creator's github. I am so happy for $OBJECT for doing this thing. I'm glad $NAME considers this a valid use of $POSADJ time. There are many other things tthat $NAME could do with this time of $POSPNN, but $SUBJECT has taken it upon $REFLEX to run this program instead.
